Protect Your Family
===================

# Creature Variants

Fast but uses poor pathfinding
Slower but uses perfect pathfinding
"Carve through" power
Lift speed multiplier (when carrying person)
Toughness (amount of damage required to kill)

# Tasks

BUG: Repeatedly mashing the fire key while pointing any direction but right with a turret makes it jump around silly.


Post Mortem
    Xcode/clang has gotten far more unstable
    Restart of idea
    Statistics: changes over the weekend.


Add embedded version. This almost works, but keyboard doesn't. DEBUG preventDefault() in an iFrame.

Port to iOS
    Controls
    Remove key hints

Maybe Android version
Play LD games

Distribute X number of items randomly in suitable tiles, rather than asking each tile, to keep things more consistent.

BUG: Turrets should stop working after game over. (Else they kill the last human's attacker and you have a live human after the end.)

Make "raked" map area more useful -- good for treasure, e.g.

More monster types -- at least fast+weak/slow+strong

    Faded enough to not grate
    Ominous, I think. But with folksy, plaintiff element, like uilleann pipes or other Irish/medieval instrument.
    Pretty long: at least 2â€“3 minutes ideally. But watch out for megabytage.
    provide mute through pause

Bonus
    Pause button/options/restart
    Difficulty selection
    Explosive Barrel
    Clock font monospace to avoid shifting
    Flash human when it becomes player
    Newly placed items should block light (update static blockers in TileGrid in that area).

Fix scaling problem

    Desired behavior:
        When stage aspect is < desired, we scale up stage height while keeping width constant. (the current behavior)
        When it is > desired (window too wide) we scale down stage width while keeping height constant.
        If stage aspect is 0, we do the current behavior, for legacy.

XXX Mines no longer hurt carried humans.
XXX Mines go green when about to explode. Oops.
XXX Make flash of some kind when a new object is "provided."
XXX Humans shouldn't wander over other humans, or items if they can help it.
XXX Fork "original" web version.
XXX Fix scaling problem
XXX Reduce the initial number of at-home items to make a more adaptive situation.

XXX Fix computeStageDimensions. Will need fairly drastic fix, I think.

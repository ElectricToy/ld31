Ludum Dare 31
=============

# Goals

1. Make an even better game than last time.
2. Create interesting decisions.
3. Make it immediately accessible. The challenge for the player isn't knowing *what* to do, or *how* to do it, but how to do it *well.*
4. Make it human.
5. Make it beautiful.
6. Make it vivid, eye-catching.
7. Make it widely available through the web.
8. Make a complete game with all the parts.
9. Keep open the possibility of a touch interface.
10. Convey an organic quality.
11. Make it funny.
12. Use pixel art, sfxr, retro aspects (for ease of production).

# Theme

"Entire game on one screen."

No scrolling.
No camera movement.
No objects allowed outside the borders of the screen.
No context shifts. No "rooms."

Examples:

*   Pong
*   Dig Dug
*   Joust
*   Geometry Wars
*   Robotron 2084

Counterexample:

*   Xevious
*   Zaxxon
*   Gauntlet   
*   McPixel

Dangers:

*   Highly static
*   Gameplay: everything is visible

Impetuses:

*   A lot of movement/color/variety
*   Emphasize the border/constraint

# Genre

Action game - Robotron
Top-down sneaker/tower defense/RPG
Platformer
Space
Arcade
Vector?

# Elements

Border is an obstacle? (instant death?) Opportunity (resource?)

Old-school barrel distortion on screen with other effects: bloom, noise, scanlines...

Fluid dynamics?

Filling the screen loses? I.e. screen is a "tray" or container.

# Brainstorming

Space shoot-em-up
Pong variant
Pong RPG
*** Micro RPG
Tetris RPG
Maze
Music paper
Paint
Light cells to solve
Atari 2600 style
Arcade style
"Rip off" with fluid dynamics
Bad guys trying to steal your stuff. "Scrub" to blow them away
Space ship through maze to core with fluid dynamics
Trying to stop bad guys from leaving the screen
* Sunrise/sunset
* Seasons
Farming
Farming/mining
Screen is glass and you can mark on it in separate mode. Game is literally "on" the screen.
*** Tree evolving; pixel sand style construction, so little to no art
Factory. Robots. Productivity. Produktiv.
Lode Runner
Bilestode. Atari 800/Apple ][-style sword carnage
Space/gravity
Tempest
Construction. Move blocks around to build buildings.
Fire fighting
Sim village
GTA-style driving RPG
Staring contest
Chat
Bugs on a windshield
Black and white, 1950s style? Cartoon sound effects.

## Tree growth

Seasons
Pixel cell simulation
Player influences growth
No real score, but length of survival is "success"? 
Screenshot postings of "mature" tree?
Seems difficult--a lot hinging on "the system."

This is growing on me again. Trees consist of "cells" that behave simple rules. The cells slowly grow. Wind, water, sun produce general effects that the player can control. Dangers like bugs, rot, ice, snow, and fire are obstacles.

I'm starting to see a beautiful game. What is the gameplay?

It's an interactive toy, really. Player can control wind, sunlight, rain. At the end, can post screenshot via Twitter or Facebook.

## Micro RPG

Here's an example: http://www.dannyburbol.com/games/micro-rpg/

We would do a sort of NES-style game, but with the whole game visible at all times, including the boss monster.

All the nice RPG elements: stats, level ups, characters, conversation, combat. No sub-views (such as combat): everything is right in-world. (Could use lens effect for that.)

Concerned about the sheer construction size. Lots of art, conversation, story, space to produce. 

Pretty throw-away too.

## Chat

Players are paired off without explanation. They are allowed to chat for one screen's worth of text. Lines count down rather than up. At 0 the "game" is over. So what's the game? Maybe you're given a "prompt" at the top and this is your "role." Maybe the other player is quizzed as to your performance.

# Growth

Tree game.

Let's just go for it and see what happens.

I don't think I want an asian style per se. More cutline or Edward Gorey, I hope.
